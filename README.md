## 📈 Sample Predictions

### Example 1: Safe Conditions
```
Input: Wind=25km/h, Temp=22°C, Humidity=65%, UV=7, Clouds=30%, Pressure=1013hPa, Visibility=10km
Output: ✅ SAFE TO WINDSURF (Confidence: 92.3%)
Tips: Great conditions! Use reef-safe sunscreen, bring reusable water bottle
```

### Example 2: Caution Conditions
```
Input: Wind=40km/h, Temp=28°C, Humidity=45%, UV=9, Clouds=20%, Pressure=1018hPa, Visibility=12km
Output: ⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION (Confidence: 87.1%)
Tips: Strong winds detected. Wear safety gear, stay close to shore
```

### Example 3: Unsafe Conditions
```
Input: Wind=8km/h, Temp=18°C, Humidity=80%, UV=3, Clouds=90%, Pressure=1008hPa, Visibility=5km
Output: 🚫 NOT SAFE FOR WINDSURFING (Confidence: 94.7%)
Tips: Low wind and poor visibility. Wait for better conditions
